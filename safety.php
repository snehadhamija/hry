   <br>
   <p>Quality and Food Safety have become competitive edge in the global market for food products. For the alround development of the food processing sector in the country, various aspect of Total Quality Management (TQM) such as quality control, quality system and quality assurance should operate in a horizontal fashion. Apart from this, in the interest of consumer safety and public health, there is a need to ensure that the quality food products manufactured and sold in the market meet the stringent parameters prescribed by the food safety regulator. Keeping in view the aforesaid objectives, government has been extending financial assistance under the scheme under the following components:  </p> <p><br /></p>                                              <!--<a href="/Archives" title="view all archive">Archive</a>-->               <div style="margin-top:25px;"> <b>Contact Details:</b> <p>Sh.

   <h1 id="11">1. About Setting Up/Up-gradation of Quality Control/Food Testing Laboratories</h1>  <p>In the interest of consumer safety and public health, there is a need for testing food products in order to ensure that it complies with domestic standards as well as international standards for exports. There is also a need for testing of all imported food products to ensure that they are of the requisite standard and food products not permitted for manufacture domestically are not allowed to come in from foreign markets. Apart from this, the level of contaminants, additives, and pesticide residues in food items is required to be monitored regularly. Therefore, a network of food testing and analysis laboratories is required to support the surveillance system of food regulator, timely analysis of samples and ensure compliance of international and domestic standards on food in case of exports as well as imports.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Under the scheme, Central/ State Government and their organizations/ Government universities (including deemed universities) and all other implementing agencies/private sector organizations/universities (including deemed universities) are eligible to receive financial assistance for setting up of food testing laboratories.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>List of Assisted Project under FTL<a href="http://mofpi.nic.in/sites/default/files/02.11.2018_completed_labs_with_nabl_accreditation_and_fssai_notification_status-converted.pdf" target="_BLANK" title="The pdf file Open in new window"> <b>(Click Here).</b></a></p> <p><br /></p>                                              <!--<a href="/Archives" title="view all archive">Archive</a>-->               <div style="margin-top:25px;"> <b>Contact Details:</b> <p>Sh.

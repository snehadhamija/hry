of article, the application of the proprietor of the design to register it in respect of some one or more other articles comprised in that class of articles shall not be refused, nor shall the registration thereof invalidated -<br />
(a) on the ground of the design not being a new or original design, by reason only that it was so previously registered; or<br />
(b) on the ground of the design having been previously published in India or in any other country, by reason only that it has been applied to article in respect of which it was previously registered:<br />
Provided that such subsequent registration shall not extend the period of copyright in the design beyond that arising from previous registration.<br />
4) Where any person makes an application for the registration of a design in respect of any article and either-<br />
(a) that design has been previously registered by another person in respect of some other article; or<br />
(b) the design to which the application relates consists of a design previously registered by another person in respect of the same or some other article with modifications or variations not sufficient to alter the character or substantially to affect the identity
 thereof,<br />

 or by operation of law, the claimant would, if the design were then registered, be entitled thereto or to the interest of the applicant therein, or to an undivided share of the design or of that interest, the Controller may, subject to the provisions of this
 section, direct that the application shall proceed in the name of the claimant or in the names of the claimants and the applicant or the other joint applicant or applicants, accordingly<br />
as the case may require.<br />
(2) No such direction as aforesaid shall be given by virtue of any assignment or agreement made by one two or more joint applicants for registration of a design except with the consent of the other joint applicant or applicants.<br />

(a) the design is identified therein by reference to the number of the application for the registration; or<br />
(b) there is produced to the Controller an acknowledgement by the person by whom the assignment or agreement was made that the assignment or agreement relates to the design in respect of which that application is made; or (c) the rights of the claimant in respect
 of the design have been finally established by the decision of a court; or<br />
(d) the Controller gives directions for enabling the application to proceed or for regulating the manner in which it should be proceeded with under sub-section
<em>(5</em>).<br />
(4) Where one of two or more joint applicants for registration of a design dies at any time before the design has been registered, the Controller may, upon a request in that behalf made by the survivor or survivors, and with the consent of the legal representative
 of the deceased, direct that the application shall proceed in the name of the survivor or survivors alone.<br />
(5) If any dispute arises between joint applicants for registration of a design whether or in what manner the application should be proceeded with, the Controller may, upon application made to him in the prescribed manner by any of the parties, and after giving
 to all parties concerned an opportunity to be heard, give such directions as he thinks fit for enabling the application to proceed in the name of one or more of the parties alone or for regulating the manner in which it should be proceeded with, or for both
 those purposes, as the case may require.</p>
<h1><span id="9" class="bold">SECTION 9</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Certificate of registration</span></h1>
<p>(1) The Controller shall grant a certificate of registration to the proprietor of the design when registered<br />

 matter as may be prescribed and such register may be maintained wholly or partly on computer, floppies or diskettes, subject to such safeguards as may be prescribed.<br />
(2) Where the register is maintained wholly or partly on computer floppies and diskettes under sub-section (1), any reference in this Act to any entry in the register shall be construed as the reference to entry so maintained on computer, floppies or diskettes.<br />

(4) The register of designs shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of any matter by this Act directed or authorized to be entered therein.</p>

<h1><span class="bold">COPYRIGHT IN REGISTERED DESIGNS</span></h1>
<h1><span id="11" class="bold">SECTION 11</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Copyright on registration</span></h1>
<p>(1) When a design is registered, the registered proprietor of the design shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have copyright in the design during ten years from the date of registration.<br />
(2) If, before the expiration of the said ten years, application for the extension of the period of copyright is made to the Controller in the prescribed manner, the Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed fee, extend the period of copy-right for a second
 period of five years from the expiration of the original period of ten years.</p>
<h1><span id="12" class="bold">SECTION 12</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Restoration of lapsed designs</span></h1>
<p class="s4">(1) Where a design has ceased to have effect by reason of failure to pay the fee for the extension of copyright under sub-section
<em>(2) </em>of section 11, the proprietor of such design or his legal representative and where the design was held by two or more persons jointly, then, with the leave of the Controller one or more of them without jointing the others, may, within one year
 from the date on which the design ceased to have effect, make an application for the restoration of the design in the prescribed manner on payment of such fee as may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="s4">(2) An application under this section shall contain a statement, verified in the prescribed manner, fully setting out the circumstances which led to the failure to pay the prescribed fee, and the Controller may require from the applicant such
 further evidence as he may think necessary.</p>
<h1><span id="13" class="bold">SECTION 13</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Procedure for disposal of applications for restoration of lapsed designs</span></h1>
<p>(1) If, after hearing the applicant in cases where the applicant so desires or the Controller thinks fit, the Controller is satisfied that the failure to pay the fee for extension of the period of copyright was unintentional and that there has been no undue
 delay in the making of the application, the Controller shall upon payment of any unpaid fee for extension of the period of copyright together with prescribed additional fee restore the registration of design.<br />
(2) The Controller may, if he thinks fit as a condition of restoring the design, require that any entry shall be made in the register of any document or matter which under the provision of this Act, has to be entered in the register but which has not been so
 entered.</p>
<h1><span id="14" class="bold">SECTION 14</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Rights of </span>proprietor<span class="bold"> of lapsed design which have been restored</span></h1>
<p>(1) Where the registration of a design is restored, the rights of the registered proprietor shall be subject to such provisions as may be prescribed and to such other provisions as the Controller thinks fit to impose for the protection or compensation of
 persons who may have begun to avail themselves of, or have taken definite steps by contract or otherwise to avail themselves of, the benefit of applying the design between the date when the registration of the design ceased to have effect and the date of restoration
 of the registration of the design.<br />
(2) No suit or other proceeding shall be commenced in respect of piracy of a registered design or infringement of the copyright in such design committed between the date on which the registration of the design ceased to have effect and the date of the restoration
 of the design.</p>
<h1><span id="15" class="bold">SECTION 15</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Requirements before delivery on sales</span></h1>
<p>(1) Before delivery on sale of any articles to which a registered design has been applied, the proprietor shall-<br />
(a) (if exact representations or specimens were not finished on the application for registration) furnish to the Controller the prescribed number of exact representations or specimens of the design; and, if he fails to do so, the Controller may, after giving
 notice thereof to the proprietor, erase his name from the register and thereupon the copyright in the design shall cease; and<br />
(b) cause each such article to be marked with the prescribed mark, or with the prescribed words or figures denoting that the design is registered; and, if he fails to do so, the proprietor shall not be entitled to recover any penalty or damages in respect of
 any infringement of his copyright in the design unless he shows that he took all proper steps to ensure the marking of the article, or unless he shows that the infringement took place after the person guilty thereof knew or had received notice of the existence
 of the copyright in the design.<br />
(2) Where a representation is made to the Central Government by or on behalf of any trade or industry that in the interest of the trade or industry it is expedient to dispense with or modify as regards any class or description of articles any of the requirements
 of this section as to marking, the Central Government may, if it thinks fit, by rule under this Act, dispense with or modify such requirements as regards any such class or description of articles to such extent and subject to such conditions as it thinks fit.</p>
<h1><span id="16" class="bold">SECTION 16</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Effect of disclosure on copyright</span></h1>
<p>The disclosure of a design by the proprietor to any other person, in such circumstances as would make it contrary to good faith for that other person to use or publish the design, and the disclosure of a design in breach of good faith by any person, other
 than the proprietor of the design, and the acceptance of a first and confidential order for articles bearing a new or original textile design intended for registration, shall not be deemed to be a publication of the design sufficient to invalidate the copyright
 thereof if registration thereof is obtained subsequently to the disclosure or acceptance.</p>
<h1><span id="17" class="bold">SECTION 17</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Inspection of registered designs</span></h1>
<p>(1) During the existence of copyright in a design, any person on furnishing such information as may enable the Controller to identify the design and on payment of the prescribed fee may inspect the design in the prescribed manner.<br />
(2) Any person may, on application to the Controller and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed, obtain a certified copy of any registered design.</p>
<h1><span id="18" class="bold">SECTION 18</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Information as to the existence of copyright</span></h1>
<p>On the request of any person furnishing such information as may enable the Controller to identify the design, and on payment of the prescribed fee, the Controller shall inform such person whether the registration still exists in respect of the design, and,
 if so, in respect of what classes of articles, and shall state the date of registration, and the name and address of the registered proprietor.</p>
<h1><span id="19" class="bold">SECTION 19</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Cancellation of registration</span></h1>
<p>(1) Any person interested may present a petition for the cancellation of the registration of a design at any time after the registration of the design, to the Controller on any of the following grounds, namely:-<br />
(a) that the design has been previously registered in India; or<br />
(b) that it has been published in India or in any other country prior to the date of registration; or<br />
(c) that the design is not a new or original design; or<br />
(d) that the design is not registrable under this Act; or<br />
(e) it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.<br />
(2) An appeal shall lie from any order of the Controller under this section to the High Court, and the Controller may at any time refer any such petition to the High Court, and the High Court shall decide any petition so referred.</p>
<h1><span id="20" class="bold">SECTION 20</span></h1>
<h1><span class="bold">Designs to bind Government</span></h1>
<p>A registered design shall have to all intents the like effect as against the Government as it has against any person and the provisions of Chapter XVII of the Patents Act,<br />
1970 (39 of 1970) shall apply to registered designs as they apply to patents.</p>
<p class="s4"><span class="bold">CHAPTER IV</span></p>

 or to do anything with a view to enable the design to be so applied; or<br />
(b) to import for the purposes of sale, without the consent of the registered proprietor, any article belonging to the class in which the design has been registered, and having applied to it the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof, or<br />

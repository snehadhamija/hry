                    lead to substantial increase in export business, it has been 
                    decided to operate a new scheme called <b>MSME Exporters Market

<p align=justify><b><A NAME="market">SECTOR-SPECIFIC MARKET STUDIES</A></b><br><br>
                      Financial assistance for the conduct of market studies would 
                      be available for industry associations/EPCs/FIEO. These 
                      should be sector specific and in respect of those sectors 
                      where MSMEs have a significant presence. This will include 
                      studies commissioned by industry associations to assess 
                      impact of WTO agreements on a specific sector. The Office 
                      of DC(MSME) may also commission such studies independently 
                      under this scheme. Assistance for commissioned studies would 
                      be limited to an overall ceiling of Rs.2 lakhs per study.</p>

<p align=justify><b><a name="anti">ANTI-DUMPING CASES</a></b><br><br>
                      With the opening up of the economy, the use of unfair trade 
                      practices has come into sharper focus. Establishing the 
                      use of unfair trade practices such as dumping requires much 
                      groundwork. Assistance for initiating/contesting anti-dumping 
                      cases will therefore be made available to MSME associations. 
                      Such assistance would be limited to 50% of total costs involved 
                      or Rs. 1 lakh whichever is lower.<br>
                      <br>
                      Proposals in respect of market assistance/sector studies 
                      and for anti-dumping cases must be self-contained and should 
                      include details of activities proposed to be undertaken, 
                      breakup of costs in respect of each activity, bio-data of

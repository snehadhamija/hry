								<p style="text-indent:20px">The primary task of the labour wing is maintenance of industrial peace and grievance redressal and the inspections under the various labour laws are conducted only to provide corollary support for compliance of labour laws, therefore, henceforth there shall be no quota of inspections for the field staff. </p>
								<p style="text-indent:20px">Therefore, the fundamental criteria for the computerized identification of units based upon risk assessment for statutory inspections and also for the purpose of grievance redressal for corollary support for maintenance of industrial peace would be as follow:-</p>
								<p><strong>Observations and Complaints regarding:-</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>(a) Non entry of names of workers in the muster roll or non maintenance of statutory record â€“ which logically leads to violation of various labour laws.</li>
									<li>(b) Non-payment of wages or less payment of wages than minimum rates of wages in violation of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.</li>
									<li>(c) Industrial disputes of serious nature and apprehended breach of law or industrial peace due to such disputes.</li>
									<li>(d) Non maintenance of facilities for security health and welfare for women employed in the night shift, in accordance with the directions of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court and the preconditions laid down in the permission for the purpose; or employment of women in the night without proper permission as per law. </li>
									<li>(e) Deployment of contract labour to the extent of 50% or more of the total strength of manpower.</li>
									<li>(f) Non remittance of contributions to the Labour Welfare Fund under the Punjab Welfare fund Act, 1965.</li>
								</ol>
								<p style="text-indent:20px">Accordingly, the list of units to be inspected will be prepared separately for the labour wing at head office and the inspection will be of two types â€“ </p>
								<ol>
									<li>i) Inspections based on risk assessment of units whose names are randomly generated by the computer from available database of establishments on the website; such inspections will be on the basis of criteria listed at (d), (e) and (f) mentioned above.</li>
									<li>ii) Inspections on the basis of complaints and information received from the field Officers on real time basis on the basis of criteria listed in (a), (b) and (c) above. This information will also have to be provided by the field Officers in their reports regularly to enable the O/o Labour Commissioner to assess the requirement of inspection.</li>
								</ol>
								<p style="text-indent:20px">As stated above, the primary concern would be non-entry of names of workers on the muster roll, the non-payment of wages or less payment of wages, if detected during the inspections for which legal action will be initiated only after giving the employer ample opportunity for taking corrective action. However If there is some other deficiency of maintenance of record which is not vital to secure such rights of the workers as mentioned above, then all efforts will be made to get the compliance done by the employer and there will be no prosecution.</p>
								<p>The restrictions and guidelines in this Transparent Inspection Scheme would not apply for inspections regarding Child Labour and Bonded Labour; as also for units which have not been registered under any law.</p>

   <br>
<p> In the budget speech of Union Budget 2018-19, a new Scheme “Operation Greens” was announced on the line of “Operation Flood”, with an outlay of Rs.500 crore to promote Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs #), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management. Accordingly, the Ministry has formulated a scheme for integrated development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain.</p> <p> <br /></p> <h2>Objectives:</h2> <p>i.	 Enhancing value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions to strengthen TOP production clusters and their FPOs, and linking/connecting them with the market.<br /> ii.	 Price stabilisation for producers and consumers by proper production planning in the TOP clusters and introduction of dual use varieties.<br /> iii.	 Reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage capacity linking consumption centres.<br /> iv.	 Increase in food processing capacities and value addition in TOP value chain with firm linkages with production clusters.<br /> v.	 Setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.<br /><br /></p> <h2>Strategies:</h2> <p> The scheme will have two-pronged strategy ofPrice stabilisation measures (for short term) and Integrated value chain development projects (for long term).</p> <h3>(I) Short term Price Stabilisation Measures </h3> <p>NAFED will be the Nodal Agency to implement price stabilisation measures. MoFPI will provide 50% of the subsidy on the following two components:</p> <p>i.	Transportation of Tomato Onion Potato(TOP) Crops from production to storage;<br /> ii.	Hiring of appropriate storage facilities for TOP Crops;</p> <h3>Market Intelligence and Early Warning System</h3> <p>MIEWS Dashboard and Portal is a platform for monitoring prices of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and for generating alerts for intervention under the terms of the Operation Greens scheme. The portal would disseminate all relevant information related to TOP crops such as Prices and Arrivals, Area, Yield and Production, Imports and Exports, Crop Calendars, Crop Agronomy, etc in an easy to use visual format.<b><a href="https://miews.nafed-india.com/" target="_BLANK" title="External site that opens in a new window">(Click Here).</a></b></p> <h3>(II) Long Term Integrated value chain development projects</h3> <p>i.	Formation and Capacity Building of FPOs<br /> ii.	Quality Production<br /> iii.	Post-harvest processing facilities - At Farm Level<br /> iv.	Post-harvest processing facilities - At Main Processing Site<br /> v.	Agri-Logistics<br /> vi.	Marketing/Consumption Points<br /><br /></p> <p> Proposals for seeking assistance under the scheme are invited .

   <h1 id="3"> Pattern Of Assistance </h1><br>
    <h3>I.	For Price Stabilisation Measures</h3> <p>50% of cost of transportation and 50% of cost of hiring appropriate storage facilities will be provided as subsidy at the time of harvest.  Storage facilities will be hired for a maximum period of 4 to 6 months. NAFED will be nodal agency for disbursement of subsidy under this component to the eligible organization.</p> <h3>II. 	For Integrated value chain development projects</h3> <p>Since the scheme envisage integrated development of TOP value chain, it should preferably have all the components listed above from A to E (Para 4.2) under Integrated value chain development project. The Post-harvest processing facilities including secondary processing facilities will be mandatory components of the Integrated value chain development project. The projects will be eligible for grant-in-aid at the rate of 50% of the eligible project cost in all areas, subject to maximum Rs. 50 crore per project. However, in case where PIA is/are FPO(s), the grant-in-aid will be at the rate of 70% of the eligible project cost in all areas, subject to maximum Rs. 50 crore per project.</p> <p><br /></p>     <h1 id ="4"> Implementation </h1><br>

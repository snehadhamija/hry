<center>	<h3> <u>Copyright Registrations in Haryana </h3></u><br></center>
<p> Copyrights do not protect names, ideas or titles. The main aim of copyright registration in India is to let copyright registrants gain economic rewards for their efforts and thus encourage further creativity and development of new materials that benefit the country.</p>
<br>
<p>

We act as an independent registrar for any works of copyright. You can deposit anything that is copyrightable with us such as original literary, musical, dramatic, artistic works and sound recordings, including novels, poems, paintings, lyrics, songs, drawings, computer images, software, advertisements, logos, and even the rules of a game. If you want to protect your work, you need to go through a copyright registration in Haryana.

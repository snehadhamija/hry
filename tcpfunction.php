					<b>6.</b>	As enumerated on serial No.2 (on page 2) the practice followed by Department may be changed to the extent that if the Development Plan is not published and the application is with respect to the industries to be located in agriculture zone of Medium & Low potential zone then power for granting Change of Land Use permission should be vest with DTCP.
					<br>
					<b>7.</b>	The provisions of Act No.41 of 1963 are not applicable on building existing prior to declaration of controlled area.  The Department has been calculating area put to use in proportion to 25% of permissible FAR achieved as per decision taken in case of Modern Diaries, Karnal.  It was felt that the existing policy is too liberal and especially in case of industries where the permissible ground coverage is 60% the existing policy provides undue benefit.  Therefore it is proposed that CLU granted area may be calculated on the basis of 60% Ground Coverage.
					<br>
					<b>8.</b>	Instead of 15% commercial component proposed to be permitted in Dhaba’s the maximum area which could be permitted shall not exceed 50 sq. mtrs.

					<b>9.</b>	The Banquet Halls/ Marriage Palaces may be allowed in Agriculture Zone.  Atleast 50% parking should be within the premises of the Banquet Hall and 50% should be provided by the owner within his own land but outside the boundary wall.  Banquet Halls/ Marriage Palaces shall not be permitted along National Highways.
